## 🚀 Projects That I'm Proud Of

### Java Food Delivery Simulator
Simulated a full food delivery system with user registration, order tracking, and real-time updates. Built with OOP principles and a clean UI.

### COVID-19 Mortality Data Analysis (Python)
Analyzed U.S. COVID-19 mortality data using Pandas and Matplotlib. Designed a CLI for filtering by date, location, and demographics.

### Raspberry Pi Water Quality Monitor (MATLAB)
Used sensors and Raspberry Pi to monitor creek water conditions. Correlated environmental data with crawfish habitats—real-world IoT in action.

### Block Dodging Game (Java, Python, Swift)
Created a fast-paced game with smooth animation and collision detection. Ported across multiple languages to showcase cross-platform skills.

### Family Business Websites
Built and maintained two responsive websites for a coffee shop and ice cream store. Focused on clean design, performance, and branding.

### Gemma3 Local AI Integration
Deployed Gemma3 locally with GPU acceleration. Engineered modular wrappers for system-level tool access and optimized Docker environments.
